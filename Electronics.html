<p><p class="lead"><b>Introduction</b></p>

India witnessed a substantial spike in demand for electronic products in the last few years; this is mainly attributed to India’s position as second-largest mobile phone manufacturer worldwide and surge in internet penetration rate. The Government of India attributes high priority to electronics hardware manufacturing, as it is one of the crucial pillars of Make in India, Digital India and Start-up India programmes.
<br><br>
The Electronics System Design & Manufacturing (ESDM) sector plays a vital role in the government’s goal of generating US$ 1 trillion of economic value from the digital economy by 2025. With various government initiatives aiming to boost domestic manufacturing, India has already started witnessing initial movement with increased production and assembly activities across products such as mobile phones and other consumer electronics.

</ul>
<p class="lead"><b>Investments</b></p>

According to the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, from April 2000 to December 2020, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) equity inflows stood at US$ 3,000.35 million.
<br><br>
The following are some recent investments and key developments in the Indian electronics and ESDM sector:
<br>
As of March 03, 2021, 19 companies have filed for the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for IT Hardware. The scheme was open for applications until April 30, 2021; its incentives will be available from April 01, 2021. Over the next four years, the scheme is expected to lead to total production of ~Rs. 160,000 crore (US$ 21.88 billion). Of the total production, IT hardware companies have proposed production of >Rs. 135,000 crore (US$ 18.46 billion); and domestic companies have proposed production of >Rs. 25,000 crore (US$ 3.42 billion).
<br><br>In April 2021, Japanese electronics brand AIWA, which registered its India subsidiary in February 2021, is relaunching with five products in the TWS (True Wireless Stereo) and audio segments at a total investment outlay of US$ 10 million for Phase-1 of operations.
<br><br>The government has set a target to get ~Rs. 18,000 crore (US$ 2.4 billion) investments in the electronics manufacturing segment by 2021-22.
<br><br>In January 2021, Panasonic Life Solutions India, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Panasonic Corporation, announced that it will invest Rs. 600 crore (US$ 82.34 million) to set a up a new electrical appliances manufacturing facility in Sri City, Andhra Pradesh.
<br><br>On February 16, 2021, Amazon announced that it will commence manufacturing of electronics products from India with Cloud Network Technology, a subsidiary of Foxconn in Chennai, later in the year. The device manufacturing programme will be able to produce ‘Fire TV Stick’ devices in large quantities every year, catering to demands of customers in India.
<br><br>In January 2021, boAt, a earphones and smart wearable manufacturer, received an investment of US$ 100 million from Warburg Pincus, a key private equity firm.
<br><br>In December 2020, Lenovo announced its plan to start manufacturing tablets in India and expand its laptop manufacturing by 10x. The company is also expecting to grow by 25-30% in the current fiscal year, due to increase in demand from the education segment and large enterprises.
<br><br>In December 2020, to establish the required ecosystem at Noida, the Indian Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) proposed the establishment of a centre of excellence in Noida for product-based Li-ion cells (post-cell). This has been approved and groundwork will begin as soon as the Government of India receives sanctions. In partnership with the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology and industrial associations, the government will create three centres of excellence.
<br><br>In November 2020, to explore incubation and mentoring opportunities for infrastructural funding and international visibility for Semiconductor Fabless Accelerator Lab (SFAL) start-ups, an MoU was signed between the Semiconductor Fabless Accelerator Lab (SFAL) and US-based Applied Materials, Inc. The agreement aims to accelerate existing fabless SMEs to the next level and promote domestic innovation and create more job opportunities in the electronics device design and manufacturing (ESDM) market.
<br><br>
<p class="lead"><b>Government Initiatives</b></p>

In May 2021, the cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi, approved a proposal by the Department of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises to implement the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme 'National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage’ to achieve manufacturing capacity of 50 GWh (Giga Watt Hour) of ACC and 5 GWh of ‘Niche’ ACC, with an outlay of Rs. 18,100 crore (US$ 2.47 billion).
<br><br>As per Union Budget 2021-22, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has been allocated Rs. 9,720.66 crore (US$ 1.33 billion). In the allocated budget, revenue expenditure allocation is Rs. 9,274.66 crore (US$ 1.27 billion) and capital expenditure allocation is Rs. 446 crore (US$ 61.34 million).

<br><br>The Government of India has allowed 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) under the automatic route in the ESDM sector. In case of electronics items for defence, FDI up to 49% is allowed under automatic route and beyond 49%, government approval is required.
<br><br>
<p class="lead"><b>Road Ahead</b></p>

Fueled by strong policy support, huge investments by public and private stakeholders and a spike in demand for electronic products, the ESDM sector in India is predicted to reach US$ 220 billion by 2025, expanding at 16.1% CAGR between 2019 and 2025.
