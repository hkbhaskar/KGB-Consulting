<p class="lead"><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>
The Indian auto-components industry has experienced healthy growth over the last few years. The auto-components industry expanded by a CAGR of 6% over FY16 to FY20 to reach US$ 49.3 billion in FY20. The industry is expected to reach US$ 200 billion by FY26.

<br><br>Due to high development prospects in all segments of the vehicle industry, the auto component sector is expected to rise by double digits in FY22.

<br><br>Auto-components industry account for 2.3% of India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs as many as 1.5 million people directly and indirectly. A stable government framework, increased purchasing power, large domestic market, and an ever-increasing development in infrastructure have made India a favourable destination for investment.
<br><br></p>
<p class="lead"><b>Market Size</b></p>
<p>
The industry can be broadly classified into organised and unorganised sectors. The organised sector caters to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and consist of high-value precision instruments while the unorganised sector comprises low-valued products and caters mostly to the aftermarket category.
<br><br>
Automobile component industry’s revenue stood at US$ 49.3 billion in FY20, up from US$ 39.05 billion in FY16 and is expected to reach US$ 200 billion by FY26. Export of auto components grew at a CAGR of 7.6% to reach Rs. 102,623 crore (US$ 14.5 billion) during the same time. As per Automobile Component Manufacturers Association (ACMA), automobile components export from India is expected to reach US$ 80 billion by 2026. The Indian auto components industry is expected to reach US$ 200 billion in revenue by 2026.
<br><br></p>
<p class="lead"><b>Investments</b></p>
<p>
The Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflow into Indian automotive* industry during the period April 2000-December 2020 stood at US$ 25.39 billion as per the data released by Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT).
<br><br>
Some of the recent investments made/planned in the Indian auto components sector is as follows:</p>
<ul>

</ul>

<p class="lead"><b>Road Ahead</b></p>
<p>
The rapidly globalising world is opening newer opportunities for the transportation industry, especially while it makes a shift towards electric, electronic and hybrid cars, which are deemed more efficient, safe, and reliable mode of transportation. Over the next decade, this will lead to newer verticals and opportunities for auto-component manufacturers, who would need to adapt change via systematic R&D.
<br><br>
As per ACMA forecasts, automobile component export from India is expected to reach US$ 80 billion by 2026. With shift in global supply chains, the Indian global automotive component trade is likely to expand at ~4-5% by 2026.
<br><br>
In December 2020, Power PSU JV EESL announced plan to install ~500 electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in the country in fiscal 2020-21.
<br><br>
The Indian auto-components industry is set to become the third largest in the world by 2025. Indian auto-component makers are well positioned to benefit from the globalisation of the sector as export potential could be increased by up to US$ 30 billion by 2021E.
